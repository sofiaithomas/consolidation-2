Project Title: "Tuple Out" Dice Game

Description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
This is a simple single player orientated game with dice. The object of the game is to score over 50 points. 
Each round consists of the player "rolling" a set of 3 dice. As the player rolls the dice, a number of things can occur.
If all 3 of the dice turn out to be the same number, the player has "tupled out" and they don't recieve any points for that turn.
Meanwhile, if the player rolls two dice that are the same number, they are now fixed. The user is prompted whether they want to re-roll the one die that is not fixed. If they don't re-roll, the original numbers in the roll are added to the players score. If they re-roll, they get the two fixed dice plus the re-rolled dice added to their score. Beware, if the player re-rolls and ends up getting the same number as the other fixed die, they "tuple" out and earn 0 points here as well. After each turn, the player's current score is displayed. The game continues until you reach a score above 50 and will tell you what that score is.
